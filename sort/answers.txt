sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Since I've found the other sort algorithms, this must be the leftover.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Merge sort is the fastest one for random sorts, and sort2 did the best amongs all three, so it must be the merge sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: I tried sorting the already sorted ones and this was the slowest one. Since the bubble sort take O(n) time to sort already sorted ones, this must be the selection sort.
